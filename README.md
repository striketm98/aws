# Cloud Computing
It is type of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand.

It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services) provisioned minimal management effort.

This relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid over an electricity network.)
